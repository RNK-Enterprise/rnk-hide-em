# My Story

I am a Game Master (GM) who has always been passionate about tabletop role-playing games. My journey into development began unexpectedly after a career as a truck driver came to an end due to health challenges. In 2021, I suffered several strokes that forced me off the road, leaving me with limited mobility and energy for outings that would otherwise exhaust me for days.

What started as simple curiosity about what a macro could do in Foundry Virtual Tabletop quickly evolved into a full-fledged passion for development. My first major creation was a 3D animated cube with 41 lines of code, which became the foundation of the RNK brand. As a self-taught developer working from my garage, I approach every project with meticulous research and innovative thinking. I refuse to settle for anything less than excellence, pushing myself to create modules that not only function flawlessly but also enhance the gaming experience for fellow GMs and players.

This work keeps me engaged and my mind active during a time when physical limitations restrict my activities. I am engaged to the love of my life, Ms. Lisa, and without her unwavering support, I wouldn't be able to bring anything that I do to the community. It is with her support and encouragement that I have excelled to become what I am today.

I will continue creating and innovating until boredom sets in or health prevents it—whatever comes first. Eventually, I will be looking for someone to take over these modules, someone with the drive and tenacity that I wake up with every day. In the meantime, I am open to collaborations if the project peaks my interest. My modules are born from this dedication, crafted with the same care and precision that defined my driving career, now channeled into the digital realm of virtual tabletop gaming.

Thank you for supporting my creations and sharing in this journey.
